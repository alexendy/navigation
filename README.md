==========

This is the source code of two simple navigation experiments: an obstacle avoidance and a maze navigation. Neural networks are generated thanks to the sferes framework to solve these tasks. Several different fitness functions are provided for comparison as well as process helpers like behavioral diversity or novelty.

These experiments have illustrated tutorials given by Stephane Doncieux on selective pressures. This was part of a larger tutorial covering different topics in evolutionary robotics and given by Nicolas Bredeche, Jean-Baptiste Mouret and Stephane Doncieux at:
* Artificial Life conference, New York, 2014
* GECCO, Madrid, 2015
* ECAL, York 2015
